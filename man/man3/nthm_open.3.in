.SH NAME
nthm_open \- start a new thread and return a pipe from it
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <nthm/nthm.h>
.sp 1
.BR nthm_pipe
.BR nthm_open
(nthm_worker
.I operator
, void *
.I operand
, int
.I *err
)
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I operator
argument is a pointer to a function that takes a
.BR void
pointer and an
.BR int
pointer and returns a
.BR void
pointer.  Compatible function pointers can be cast as such by the
.BR nthm_worker
type alias. The function
.BR nthm_open
passes the parameters
.I operand
and
.I err
to the function
.I operator
as if the caller had invoked
.sp 1
.BR retval
=
.I operator
(
.I operand
,
.I err
)
.sp 1
but runs
.I operator
in a separate thread from the caller.
On 32-bit systems, the
usable stack size allocated to the created thread is limited to
.BR NTHM_STACK_MIN
or roughly 16 Kbytes with a view to conserving virtual address
space. On 64-bit systems, the default stack size (typically 8MB) is
reserved but not physically used unless the thread's stack actually
grows to that size.
.P
The 
.I operator
function
is expected to return a value
.BR retval
the size of a pointer, whereupon the thread created for it
exits. It may also assign an error code to
.I *err.
The
.I operator
function must not directly call
.BR pthread_exit
itself.
.SH RETURN VALUE
If
.BR nthm_open
does not succeed, it returns NULL and the
.I operator
function is not called.
.P
If
.BR nthm_open
succeeds, it returns a value of type
.BR nthm_pipe
that may be used in subsequent calls to
.BR nthm_read,
.BR nthm_truncate,
.BR nthm_kill,
.BR nthm_untether,
.BR nthm_tether,
and
.BR nthm_busy.
Both the return value and the error code set by
.I operator
will be readable subsequently from
the pipe.
For example,
.sp 1
.nf
   my_pipe = nthm_open ((nthm_worker) &my_function, &some_data, err);
   ...
   retval = nthm_read (my_pipe, err);
.fi
.sp 1
Because
.BR nthm_read
might need to report an error,
error codes set by
.I operator
should be chosen not to clash with those noted below.
.SH ERRORS
Error codes are reported in
.I *err
with any non-zero value indicating an error.
.TP
*
Negative numbers from
.BR -NTHM_MIN_ERR
to
.BR -NTHM_MAX_ERR
originate from
.BR nthm.
.TP
*
A standard set of positive numbers is for POSIX
error codes.
.P
If 
.I *err
is non-zero on entry,
then
.BR nthm_open
does not succeed and does not change it.
.P
If
.I *err
is zero on entry and non-zero on exit, then
.BR nthm_open
has not succeeded and may report one of these error codes for the
reasons noted.
.TP
.BR EAGAIN
Resources or permission are insufficient to create a thread.
.TP
.BR ENOMEM
There is insufficient memory for a new thread or metadata.
.TP
.BR NTHM_KILLED
No new threads may be created because the caller's thread has been killed.
The thread may have been killed directly by its creator with
.BR nthm_kill
or
.BR nthm_kill_all
or indirectly due to the creator being killed or exiting.
.P
Any other reported error code not present initially indicates a bug in
.BR nthm
that is not actionable by users but may assist developers.  Bug
reports are most welcome.
.SH NOTES
On 64-bit systems, use this command to display the default stack size in Kbytes.
