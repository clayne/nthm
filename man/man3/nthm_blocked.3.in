.SH NAME
nthm_blocked \- test whether all open pipes are busy
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <nthm/nthm.h>
.sp 1
.BR int
.BR nthm_blocked
( int
.I *err
)
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR nthm_blocked
function tests whether or not
.BR nthm_select
would block if it were called.
This capability may be useful for polling the
availability of readable pipes.
.SH RETURN VALUE
If there are pipes with threads tethered in the
current scope that are still running but none ready to be read,
then a successful call to
.BR nthm_blocked
returns a non-zero value because
.BR nthm_select
would have blocked if it were called.
Otherwise,
.BR nthm_blocked
returns a zero value either because the call was unsuccessful or
because
.BR nthm_select
would have returned immediately without blocking.
.SH ERRORS
The value of
.I *err
is set to non-zero if it is zero on entry and
.BR nthm_blocked
is unsuccessful for any reason, but is otherwise left unchanged.
Errors indicate a failure of some internal consistency check due to
memory corruption, misuse of the API, or a bug in
.BR nthm.
Bug reports including error codes are welcome.
.SH EXAMPLE
This example shows an event loop that interleaves 
reading of previously opened
.BR nthm
pipes with other unspecified operations.
.sp 1
.NF
   while (! err)
      if (nthm_blocked (&err))
         {
           // do something other than waiting for pipes
         }
      else if (err) // not successful
         break;
      else if ((p = nthm_select (&err))  // not blocked
         {
           x = nthm_read (p, &err))
           // do something with data x read from pipe p
         }
      else          // all visible pipes have been read
         break;
.fi
