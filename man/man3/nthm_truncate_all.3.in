.SH NAME
nthm_truncate_all \- request truncation of all locally tethered treads
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <nthm/nthm.h>
.sp 1
void
.BR nthm_truncate_all
(
int
.I *err
)
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR nthm_truncate_all
function informs all threads created with
.BR nthm_open
in the current thread's context
or tethered to it with
.BR nthm_tether
that they should return a result sooner than usual by computing an
approximate solution.
.P
The semantics of
.BR nthm_truncate_all
is similar to that of calling
.BR nthm_truncate
individually for each tethered thread
with these differences.
.TP
*
Truncation is also indicated for the caller's thread. That is,
subsequent calls to
.BR nthm_truncated
within the same thread context as the caller will report a truncated
status.
.TP
*
If a source thread is truncated both individually and as a result of
.BR nthm_truncate_all
being called in its drain's context, the individual degree of
truncation takes precedence when reported by
.BR nthm_truncated
within the source thread's context.
.TP
*
If a source thread truncated due to
.BR nthm_truncate_all
being called in its drain's context is subsequently untethered before
terminating, its truncation is undone.
.TP
*
If an untethered source thread is subsequently tethered to a drain
in whose context
.BR nthm_truncate_all
was previously called, the source becomes truncated.
.P
See the manual page of
.BR nthm_truncate
for further details.
.SH RETURN VALUE
none
.SH ERRORS
Error codes are reported in the
.I *err
parameter.
Any other error code not present intially indicates either a bug in
.BR nthm
or a misuse of the API. Bug reports are appreciated.
.TP
*
If
.I *err
is non-zero on entry,
then it remains unchanged.
.TP
*
If
.I *err
is zero on entry and non-zero on exit,
then an internal consistency check has failed.
