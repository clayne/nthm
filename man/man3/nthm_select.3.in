.SH NAME
nthm_select \- return a pipe from the next thread to finish
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <nthm.h>
.sp 1
.BR nthm_pipe
.BR nthm_select
( int
.I *err
)
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.BR nthm_select
function
retrieves a pipe
whose return value is ready to be read
from among those
opened with
.BR nthm_open
in the context the caller's thread or tethered to it with
.BR nthm_tether.
.P
Interleaved calls to
.BR nthm_open,
.BR nthm_select
and
.BR nthm_read
are an efficient way to run a pool of worker threads because
.BR nthm_select
never blocks unless there is no choice because
all threads are busy.
.P
Applications can check whether a call to
.BR nthm_select
would block by polling
.BR nthm_blocked.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Each successful call to
.BR nthm_select
returns a fresh pipe previously opened within the caller's context by
.BR nthm_open
or tethered to it by
.BR nthm_tether
until there are none left, at which time
.BR nthm_select
returns NULL. If more pipes are opened or tethered later, then they
will be available via subsequent calls to
.BR nthm_select.
.P
An unsuccessful call to
.BR nthm_select
also returns a NULL result. NULL results can be disambiguated by the
error code as explained below.
.P
Any pipe returned by
.BR nthm_select
is guaranteed to be readable by
.BR nthm_read
without blocking the caller.
.TP
*
If no pipe is available for
reading without blocking but there is at least one pipe whose thread is still running, then
.BR nthm_select
blocks the caller until the next thread finishes and only then returns its pipe.
.TP
*
If multiple pipes are ready for reading without blocking, then
.BR nthm_select
returns the one that has been ready the longest and saves the
rest for subsequent calls.
.SH ERRORS
Error codes are reported in
.I *err
with any non-zero value indicating an error.
If
.I *err
is non-zero on entry, then
.BR nthm_select
leaves it unchanged.
If it is zero on entry and non-zero on exit, then
.BR nthm_select
may set
.I *err
to following code for the reason noted.
.TP
.BR NTHM_KILLED
Selecting was interrupted because the caller's thread was killed with
.BR nthm_kill
or
.BR nthm_kill_all.
.P
Undocumented error codes also may be assigned to
.I *err
if internal consistency checks fail, which are helpful in bug reports
to developers.
